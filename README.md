## What

This is a simple count-down timer to my move-in date. It's worth sharing because it demonstrates how to put a Rails application into the [appcache][1].

Visit <http://clock.meagar.net>, and then disconnect from the internet and reload the page, and the entire site will be served out of the appcache.
